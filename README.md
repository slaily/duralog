**Never lose data again. `duralog` is a high-performance Python library that makes your application's data durable without slowing it down.**

Imagine your application processes critical eventsâ€”orders, transactions, user actions. If your server crashes or loses power, how do you ensure none of that data is lost? Writing directly to a database on every event can be slow and quickly become a bottleneck.
